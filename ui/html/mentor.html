                <p class="about">I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of
                    motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself
                    daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use
                    Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any
                    design needs,so i want also to learn new skills from you and i guess i will be a quick leaner in
